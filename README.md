# Airfare-Price-Predictor
Airfare Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting airfare prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data from various airlines and flight routes, the goal is to provide a model that helps consumers make informed decisions about when to book their flights. Given the dynamic nature of airfare prices, this project aims to develop a robust model capable of capturing the nuances and trends that influence pricing.

Objectives
Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Compile and clean a comprehensive dataset containing various features such as flight dates, booking times, airlines, departure and arrival cities, routes, flight duration, and ticket prices.
Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
Feature Engineering:

Generate additional features like days until departure, seasonality factors, and demand indicators to enhance the predictive power of the model.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identify patterns, trends, and correlations in the data that can inform feature selection and model development.
Model Development:

Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models to predict airfare prices, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
Optimize model parameters using techniques like cross-validation and grid search.
Model Deployment:

Create a user-friendly interface for real-time airfare predictions based on user-input flight details.
Methodology
Data Collection & Cleaning:

The dataset used in this project contains 10,683 entries and 11 features, including airline names, flight routes, departure and arrival times, total stops, and airfare prices. The data was cleaned to handle missing values and outliers, and necessary transformations were applied.
Feature Engineering:

Additional features were engineered to capture relevant aspects of the data, such as the number of days until departure, whether the flight was during a holiday period, and time-based features like hour of departure.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

EDA was performed to uncover insights such as the influence of booking time on price, the effect of different airlines, and the impact of specific routes on pricing. Visualizations and statistical tests were used to guide feature selection and model choice.
Model Training & Evaluation:

Several machine learning models were trained, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. The models were evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), with cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
Model Deployment:

The final model was deployed in a user-friendly interface that allows users to input flight details and receive airfare predictions. This interface can be a web application or integrated into a larger system.
Conclusion
The Airfare Price Prediction project successfully developed a machine learning model that provides accurate predictions of airline ticket prices. By leveraging a diverse set of features and employing various machine learning techniques, the model offers valuable insights that can help users make more informed decisions when purchasing flight tickets. The project highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation in creating a reliable predictive model.
